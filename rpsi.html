That was in 1971. 11th August 1968 is a date burned in the memory of most enthusiasts, but far from being the end of UK steam, August 1968 marked only the retirement of BR's last tired survivors. How many people after this last sad day knew that, within the British Isles, LMS 2-6-4Ts were still working hard for their living, and would do for another two years?

After a period in the former Belfast Transport Museum in Witham Street, Belfast (now part of the UFTM collection), she was loaned to the RPSI and underwent extensive renovation in Harland & Wolff's shipyard in Belfast between 1977 and 1982. Since 1986, the RPSI has used her on tours all over Ireland, and she is one of only two surviving operational main line compound locomotives in the British Isles. As built, No.85 and her four sisters (all now scrapped) were unlined black, but the famous GNR(I) sky blue livery presently carried was applied from the mid 1930s.</p>

The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland took delivery of a new resident to its Whitehead engineering base on the 31st May 2003. The resident in question was "Q" class 4-4-0 No.131.
No.131 was built in February 1901 as part of a class of 13 4-4-0 express passenger locomotives for the Great Northern Railway (Ireland). They supplanted the various P and PP classes and were only displaced by the S class. The 4-4-0 tender locomotive was built by Neilson Reid in Glasgow. No.131 was designed under the auspices of Charles Clifford and although initially named, the name was removed in 1914. She was rebuilt with a superheated boiler, under George T. Glover (then Chief Locomotive Designer of the GNR(I)) in Dundalk works in 1920.
